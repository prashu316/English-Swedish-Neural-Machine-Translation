# English-Swedish-Neural-Machine-Translation

A research paper based on this project is currently undergoing publishing at the "ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing" journal. A preprint of the paper currently published on TechRxiv is available [here](https://www.techrxiv.org/articles/preprint/English_to_Swedish_Neural_Machine_Translation_Using_Attention/20369091/1).

## Aim
To achieve the task of neural machine translation for the use case of translating English to Swedish.

## Libraries Used
Tensorflow and Keras

## Dataset Details
The English-Swedish parallel corpus is derived from the "Tatoeba Project". Tatoeba is a large database consisting of example sentences that have been  translated  into  multiple  languages  by  its  members. The sentence pairs used for the project are among ones that have been  proof-read  by  professionals.

## Sample model outputs

NOTE: The notebook for this code is unavailable as most of the testing of various models was done locally and hence switching it over to colab seemed like a strenuous ordeal!
The raw code for the program is available in the repository!
